# Travel-website-clone.

This repository contains a clone of a travel website that I created using HTML and CSS. The original website is a platform designed to help users explore exciting travel destinations, plan dream vacations, and discover unique travel packages.

## Preview





## Technologies Used

The website clone was built using HTML and CSS. It is a static website, and no server-side technologies are required to run it locally.

## Credits

The original design and concept of the website are not mine, and I have created this project purely for educational purposes to demonstrate my HTML and CSS skills.

## Contributions

As this is a personal project for learning purposes, I am not actively seeking contributions. However, if you have any suggestions or find any issues with the code, feel free to open an issue in this repository.

## About Me
